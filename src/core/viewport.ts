 * anchor can swing across (or fly in from off) the screen mid-animation, which is
 * the artefact a fixed-anchor interpolation produces when `from` and `to` frame
 * different regions (e.g. double-clicking an off-centre panel/cell to zoom in).

 * scaled to that region and centred ON IT — not on the canvas — so an asymmetric layout
 * (a wide panel one side, a narrow one the other) still frames content in the middle of
 * what the user can see. Defaults to zero on every edge, i.e. the whole canvas.
 *
 * `minScale` is the lowest px/unit the fit may zoom OUT to; it defaults to the
 * interactive MIN_SCALE (0.25) so the main canvas's fits behave as before. The
 * OverviewMap passes a far smaller floor so a large model extent (e.g. a wide
 * many-panel unravel strip) shrinks enough to frame fully in its small box.
 *
 * Used by the mini-window thumbnails: each saved perimeter gets its own
 * fit-to-bounds viewport so the whole shape is visible regardless of its model
 * size or position. Bounds are taken from the FLATTENED outline so curves are
 * accounted for (a bulging curve extends past its anchors).
 *
 * Degenerate cases are handled so the math never divides by zero:
 *   - no vertices            -> a neutral centred viewport at the default scale.
 *   - a single point / a
 *     zero-width or
 *     zero-height bounds      -> we floor the span to a small epsilon so the
 *                               shape sits centred at a sane scale rather than

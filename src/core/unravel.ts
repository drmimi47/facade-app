/**
 * core/unravel.ts
 *
 * Pure geometry for "unravelling" (unwrapping) a perimeter: take the closed
 * shape's edges in CLOCKWISE order and lay each one out as a horizontal segment
 * along the baseline (model y = 0), left to right, with a fixed gap between them.
 *
 * This is the facade/elevation use-case: a building footprint's walls unrolled
 * flat. The defining requirement is that **each unravelled segment keeps the
 * exact length of the original edge** — straight edges use their chord length,
 * curved (Bézier) edges use their true ARC length (so a curved wall unrolls to a
 * straight strip of the same running length).
 *
 * No DOM/React/canvas here — this only produces model-space data; the renderer
 * draws it and the input layer toggles it.

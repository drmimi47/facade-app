/**
 * core/solar.ts
 *
 * Hand-written, dependency-free SOLAR GEOMETRY for the Solar Study.
 *
 * WHY hand-written (per the working agreement): the codebase is deliberately
 * dependency-free and the math here is small and standard (a few trig identities),
 * so pulling in a solar library (SunCalc, etc.) would add a dependency for ~40
 * lines of well-known astronomy. That separation has already paid off once: real
 * latitude/longitude, a time zone, and the equation of time (clock time ↔ solar
 * time) were all added HERE when the offline gazetteer landed, WITHOUT touching the
 * renderer or UI — they consume the pure functions below.
 *
 * This module is PURE DATA/MATH — no DOM, no React, no canvas.
 *
 * What's REAL here (so the study offers real data, not decoration):
 *   - Solar DECLINATION via Cooper's equation (a function of the day of year).
 *   - Solar ALTITUDE and AZIMUTH from latitude + declination + hour angle, the
 *     standard spherical-astronomy equations. Azimuth is measured FROM NORTH,
 *     CLOCKWISE (0 = N, 90 = E, 180 = S, 270 = W) — the surveyor/compass
 *     convention — so it composes directly with a building's cardinal orientation.
 *
 * TIME: `hour` is stored as LOCAL APPARENT SOLAR TIME (solar noon = 12:00), which is
 * what the astronomy above consumes. {@link solarToClock} / {@link clockToSolar}
 * convert that to and from wall-clock time using the site's longitude, its time-zone
 * meridian, and the equation of time — so the UI can present either without any of
 * the geometry below changing. The zone comes from the offline gazetteer
 * (core/gazetteer.ts) when an address is resolved.
 *
 * What is still SIMPLIFIED:
 *   - The equation of time uses the standard engineering approximation (good to well
 *     under a minute), not the full VSOP-grade series.
 *   - Atmospheric refraction near the horizon is not modelled, so altitudes within
 *     ~0.5 degrees of sunrise/sunset are geometric rather than apparent.
 *
 * Orientation model (the data the rest of the app will build cardinal facades on):
 *   - The drawn perimeter lives in model space with +X = EAST, +Y = NORTH, +Z = UP
 *     (matching core/extrude3d.ts). `northOffset` ROTATES true north relative to
 *     that model: it is the compass bearing (degrees clockwise from true north) of
 *     the model's +Y axis. northOffset = 0 means model +Y already points true north.
 *     Encoding it per saved sketch lets a later step derive each FACADE's cardinal
 *     orientation (its outward-normal bearing) and pair it with the sun positions
 *     computed here.

//      true solar noon drifts against a uniform clock by roughly -14..+16 minutes
//      over the year.
//
// The zone's UTC offset comes from the browser's own Intl data, so the app carries no

// SELECTED DAY, daylight saving is handled correctly without special-casing.

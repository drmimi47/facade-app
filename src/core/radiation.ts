/**
 * core/radiation.ts
 *
 * ANNUAL SURFACE RADIATION for a vertical facade (the "Irradiance (W/m²)" heatmap and
 * the "Insolation (kWh/m²)" monthly chart, which share this one matrix). Builds a
 * Ladybug-style temporal map: for each MONTH of the year and each
 * HOUR of the day, the clear-sky solar irradiance (W/m²) landing on ONE wall border,
 * given that wall's true compass orientation and the sketch's Solar Study settings
 * (latitude, day/season, north offset).
 *
 * WHY hand-written (per the working agreement): the codebase is deliberately
 * dependency-free and reuses the existing {@link sunPosition} astronomy from
 * core/solar.ts. The only addition here is a standard, well-documented CLEAR-SKY
 * irradiance model (Hottel's transmittance + an isotropic-sky diffuse split), ~60
 * lines of textbook physics — far less than pulling in a radiation library, and it
 * keeps the SAME orientation source of truth (compass bearings) the rest of the app
 * already uses. PURE DATA/MATH — no DOM, no React, no canvas.
 *
 * What's REAL here (so the diagram is data, not decoration):
 *   - Sun altitude/azimuth from the shared spherical-astronomy model (core/solar.ts).
 *   - Beam irradiance via Hottel's clear-sky transmittance (a function of solar
 *     zenith + site altitude), scaled by the day's extraterrestrial normal flux.
 *   - Diffuse (sky) irradiance via Liu–Jordan's transmittance correlation, deposited
 *     on the vertical wall isotropically, plus a small ground-reflected term.
 *   - The wall's INCIDENCE: only the component of the beam facing the wall counts, so
 *     a west wall lights up in the afternoon and a north wall stays cool — driven by
 *     the wall's true compass bearing (its outward normal), exactly like the
 *     Orientation Heatmap.
 *
 * What is SIMPLIFIED:
 *   - CLEAR-SKY only: no clouds/weather file (no EPW yet). Values are a clear-day
 *     upper envelope, consistent month-to-month, which is what the comparative
 *     diagram needs. A later step can swap in measured TMY/EPW data behind the same
 *     {@link RadiationMatrix} shape without touching the UI. This remains the model's
 *     dominant error term — far larger than anything site resolution contributes.
 *   - `hour` is LOCAL APPARENT SOLAR TIME (solar noon = 12:00), matching core/solar.ts.
 *     The Solar Study can DISPLAY it as wall-clock time (see solarToClock there); the
 *     matrix itself is always built on solar time so its columns stay comparable.
